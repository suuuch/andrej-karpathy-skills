# Using this repo with Cursor

This project includes a **Cursor project rule** so the Karpathy-inspired behavioral guidelines apply automatically when you work here.

## In this repository

1. Open the folder in Cursor.
2. The rule [`.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc`](.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc) is committed with `alwaysApply: true`, so you do not need extra installation steps.
3. In Cursor, you can confirm it under **Settings → Rules** (or the project rules UI), where `karpathy-guidelines` should appear.

## Use the same guidelines in another project

**Cursor (recommended):** Copy `.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc` into that project’s `.cursor/rules/` directory (create the folders if needed). Adjust or merge with existing rules as you like.

**Other tools:** If a stack only supports a root instruction file, copy [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) into that project instead (or merge its contents into your existing instructions).

## Optional: personal Agent Skills

If you want the same content as a reusable skill under `~/.cursor/skills`, use [`skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md`](skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md). You can copy or symlink it into your personal skills directory; use whatever layout you use for other skills.

## Claude Code vs Cursor

- **Claude Code:** Install via the plugin marketplace and [`README.md`](README.md) instructions; the plugin exposes the skill from this repo. Per-project use can also rely on `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Cursor:** Use the committed `.cursor/rules/` file as described above. Cursor does not read `.claude-plugin/` or `CLAUDE.md` by default.

## For contributors

When you change the four principles, keep **[`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md)** and **[`.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc`](.cursor/rules/karpathy-guidelines.mdc)** in sync. If the published skill/plugin text should match, update **[`skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md`](skills/karpathy-guidelines/SKILL.md)** as well.


## Core Development Rules


1. Code Quality
   - Type hints required for all code
   - Public APIs must have docstrings
   - Functions must be focused and small
   - Follow existing patterns exactly
   - Line length: 88 chars maximum

2. Testing Requirements
   - Framework: `uv run pytest`
   - Async testing: use anyio, not asyncio
   - Coverage: test edge cases and errors
   - New features require tests
   - Bug fixes require regression tests

3. Code Style
    - PEP 8 naming (snake_case for functions/variables)
    - Class names in PascalCase
    - Constants in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
    - Document with docstrings
    - Use f-strings for formatting


## Python Tools

## Package Management
   - ONLY use uv
   - Installation: `uv add package`
   - Running tools: `uv run tool`
   - Upgrading: `uv add --dev package --upgrade-package package`
   - FORBIDDEN: `uv pip install`, `@latest` syntax


## Code Formatting
1. Ruff
   - Format: `uv run ruff format .`
   - Check: `uv run ruff check .`
   - Fix: `uv run ruff check . --fix`
   - Critical issues:
     - Line length (88 chars)
     - Import sorting (I001)
     - Unused imports
   - Line wrapping:
     - Strings: use parentheses
     - Function calls: multi-line with proper indent
     - Imports: split into multiple lines

2. Type Checking
   - Tool: `uv run pyright`
   - Requirements:
     - Explicit None checks for Optional
     - Type narrowing for strings
     - Version warnings can be ignored if checks pass

3. Pre-commit
   - Config: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Runs: on git commit
   - Tools: Prettier (YAML/JSON), Ruff (Python)
   - Ruff updates:
     - Check PyPI versions
     - Update config rev
     - Commit config first
